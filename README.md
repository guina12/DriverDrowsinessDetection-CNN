# AI Project: Sleep Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Welcome to our AI project focused on sleep detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project integrates advanced data science techniques and software engineering to achieve accurate and efficient results.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage CNNs to detect sleep patterns from physiological signals and images. The goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately predicting different stages of sleep.

## Features

- **Data Structure:** Utilizes stack-based image management and object-oriented programming for modular code.
- from IPython.display import display, Image
  gif_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/stackabuse/media/linked-list-programming-interview-questions-1.gif"
  display(Image(url=gif_url, width=600, height=250))

- **Database:** Relational database integration for efficient data organization and processing pipelines.
- **DataFrame and Pipelines:** Efficient data manipulation with DataFrames and preprocessing pipelines.
- **CNN Modeling:** Trains CNNs, including advanced architectures like ResNet, for precise sleep stage identification.
- **Accident Prevention:** Practical application in road safety by detecting driver drowsiness and preventing accidents.
- **Project Architecture:** Modular and scalable architecture for easy maintenance and expansion.
- **Results:** Demonstrates effective data handling and modeling techniques with promising outcomes.
